**The CSV Data Analyzer and Reporter project aims to design and develop a Python-based application that reads input data from a CSV file, performs statistical calculations, and generates a comprehensive report in PDF format. The application will read input data from a user-specified CSV file, allowing users to easily import and analyze their data.

Once the data is imported, the application will perform various statistical calculations, including maximum value, minimum value, standard deviation, and percentage calculation based on a user-specified reference value. These calculations will provide users with valuable insights into their data and enable them to make informed decisions.

The application will then generate a PDF report using the ReportLab and FPDF libraries. The report will include a summary table with the calculated statistical values, a detailed table with the original input data, and an optional chart or graph to visualize the data. This report will provide users with a clear and concise overview of their data, making it easier to understand and analyze.

To further enhance the reporting capabilities, the application will allow users to customize the report layout, font, and colors. This flexibility will enable users to tailor the report to their specific needs and preferences.

From a technical perspective, the application will be built using Python 3.x and will leverage the pandas library for CSV data manipulation. The ReportLab and FPDF libraries will be used to generate the PDF report.**
